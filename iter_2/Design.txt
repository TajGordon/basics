In order to be a metroidvania,
needs to be open world, where you can go anywhere
- if you could only get past that one little thing, that jump that's just a little bit too high to make it

We are making a tiny game, for a game jam

      PLOT
******************
You're weakened, starving, and pitiful.
Regain your strength by drinking the blood of enemies.
But the putrid blood of weak enemies makes you sick,
you need something better.
Crippled, you've lost all your abilities,
you must regain your strength, to take revenge on your enemies.

Blood is a vampire's source of strength.
Drink more to power up, and unlock your past powers.

Vampire themed abilities?
    Bat shit? - Gaining the ability to become a bat for a shot period of time?
        Having a short period of time being small and flying would be able to get to new areas
        How do we unlock the ability to become a bat?
            Reaching a high enough blood level?

have like a "locked door" but you can just open it
have a pathway with boulders blocking it and a "hmm, if only I could blast these boulders"
have the entrance to the boss be marked "secret exit"

blood magic = make a blood spike appear from any blood puddles or things on the ground
